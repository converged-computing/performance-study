# Performance Study

This study will test HPC application performance across three clouds. The repository is organized as follows:

- [docker](docker): includes container builds for different environments. Containers are shared between environments when possible to reduce redundancy.
  - [google](docker/google): includes Google builds for each of CPU an GPU
  - [aws](docker/aws): includes AWS builds for each of CPU and GPU. The distinguishing feature is building with libfabric for EFA.

- [experiments](experiments): are organized first by cloud, and then the underlying environment. In each, a README with the full experiment protocol (and usually commands to run) are included.
 - [Google Cloud](experiments/google) includes HPC Toolkit (Compute Engine), and GKE (Kubernetes) for each of CPU and GPU
 - [Amazon Web Services](experiments/aws) includes Parallel Cluster (EC2), and EKS (KUbernetes) for each of CPU and GPU
 - [Microsoft Azure](experiments/azure) includes CycleCloud (VMs), and AKS (Kubernetes) for each of CPU and GPU.

## Timing

This is a checklist for the setups we have tested and timed:
