# AWS Parallel Cluster

> GPU edition!

This setup study aims to prototype using [AWS parallel cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/install-v3-virtual-environment.html). Note that since this requires nodejs we will be using a Docker container. It is extended from [our original test](https://github.com/converged-computing/metrics-operator-experiments/tree/main/performance/testing/slurm/aws-0). Build the container:

```bash
docker build -t cowpie .
```

üí©Ô∏è

We need to build a custom GPU image (takes a little over an hour):

```bash
pcluster build-image --image-configuration build.yaml --image-id pcluster-gpu-u2204-base --region us-east-1 --suppress-validators type:InstanceTypeBaseAMICompatibleValidator --rollback-on-failure true
```

Get the status (it takes a long time, geez):

```bash
pcluster describe-image --image-id performance-study-p3dn-gpu-image --region us-east-1
```

When it's done:

```
root@e18710f746ac:/tmp/data# pcluster list-images --region us-east-1 --image-status AVAILABLE
{
  "images": [
    {
      "imageId": "performance-study-p3dn-gpu-image",
      "imageBuildStatus": "BUILD_COMPLETE",
      "ec2AmiInfo": {
        "amiId": "ami-0f468aafaa37bccb4"
      },
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "version": "3.10.1"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

### 1. Shell into container

Shell into the container. Note that you likely want to copy over your pem keyfile (and bind the present working directory with it) to get ssh access.
 
```bash
# For this you will need to export AWS credentials
docker run --workdir /tmp/data -it -v $PWD/:/tmp/data cowpie

# This uses default credentials
docker run --workdir /tmp/data -it -v $PWD/:/tmp/data -v /home/vanessa/.aws:/root/.aws  cowpie
```

`pcluster` should be on the path.

```bash
# which pcluster
/env/bin/pcluster
```

### 3. Automate subnet

I had trouble creating the subnet, so I used `pcluster configure` first to make it for me (and in the right zone, etc).

```bash
cd /tmp
pcluster configure --config make-subnet.yaml --region us-east-1
```
Here were my choices:

```console
INFO: Configuration file make-subnet.yaml will be written.

The EC2 instance selected supports enhanced networking capabilities using Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA). EFA enables you to run applications requiring high levels of inter-node communications at scale on AWS at no additional charge (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/efa-v3.html).

Enabling EFA requires compute instances to be placed within a Placement Group. Please specify an existing Placement Group name or leave it blank for ParallelCluster to create one.

Creating CloudFormation stack...
Do not leave the terminal until the process has finished.
Stack Name: parallelclusternetworking-pub-20240601045123 (id: arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:633731392008:stack/parallelclusternetworking-pub-20240601045123/bffa7470-1fd2-11ef-bf57-06b62ba9e52d)
Status: parallelclusternetworking-pub-20240601045123 - CREATE_COMPLETE          
The stack has been created.
Configuration file written to make-subnet.yaml
You can edit your configuration file or simply run 'pcluster create-cluster --cluster-configuration make-subnet.yaml --cluster-name cluster-name --region us-east-2' to create your cluster.
```

The main thing that matters is the VPC/subnet I think. Then copy over those parts of the conig file.

### 3. Create the pcluster!

We already have our [config-file.yaml](config-file.yaml)

```bash
pcluster create-cluster --cluster-name test-cluster --cluster-configuration config-file.yaml --suppress-validators=ALL --rollback-on-failure true
```

ONLY disable validators after checking:

1. The only issue is the instance type / custom AMI
2. You have updated the config to use your custom AMI!

That seemed to work! Of course we aren't actively monitoring the creation status.

```console
{
  "cluster": {
    "clusterName": "test-cluster",
    "cloudformationStackStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
    "cloudformationStackArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-1:633731392008:stack/test-cluster/89d01d90-56e2-11ef-a506-126287008d5b",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "version": "3.10.1",
    "clusterStatus": "CREATE_IN_PROGRESS",
    "scheduler": {
      "type": "slurm"
    }
  }
}
```

We can do that as follows:

```bash
pcluster describe-cluster --cluster-name test-cluster --region us-east-1
```

This is what you see when it's done (easily 15-20 minutes)

```console
[
  {
    "clusterName": "test-cluster",
    "cloudformationStackStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE",
    "cloudformationStackArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:633731392008:stack/test-cluster/7dd6bbc0-1fd3-11ef-a35d-0ab4855fa11f",
    "region": "us-east-2",
    "version": "3.9.2",
    "clusterStatus": "CREATE_COMPLETE",
    "scheduler": {
      "type": "slurm"
    }
  }
]

```

You can also watch cloud formation in the AWS console. This is another way to see that:

```console
pcluster list-clusters --query 'clusters[?clusterName==`test-cluster`]' --region us-east-1
```

Now let's shell in! This is where you'll need your pem mounted in the pwd.

```console
pcluster ssh --region us-east-1 --cluster-name test-cluster -i ./tachos-cat.pem
```

**IMPORTANT** I spent two days trying to debug why my pem key didn't work, and one that had worked before, and (for some reason) it was just old, because I created a new one and it worked. If you get permission denied try making a new one. üôÉÔ∏è

Note that since we asked for our nodes (minimum) to be created off the bat, we shouldn't have to wait. If you did a minimum value of 1, you would need to wait, which isn't ideal. This should be available immediately:

```bash
$ sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
queue1*      up   infinite      3   idle queue1-st-hpc6a48xlarge-[1-3]
```

Let's try creating a job to install singularity, the script [install-job.sh](install-job.sh).
Note that you can also run this manually on the head node (this is ideal if you don't have your queue yet).
That seemed to work. I'm not sure why srun did not.

```bash
$ sbatch -N 2 ./install-job.sh
Submitted batch job 1
ubuntu@ip-10-0-0-109:~$ squeue
             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
                 1    queue1 install-   ubuntu  R       0:17      3 queue1-st-hpc6a48xlarge-[1-3]
```

I also ran the script locally to install on the head node. This makes me realize we probably want a shared directory to pull / use containers from.

```bash
/bin/bash ./install-job.sh
```

### 4. Pull containers

We can pre-pull all the containers that we need.

At this point you can run experiments! I'm going to prototype with flux with VMs since we are intending to run there - I don't want to learn slurm again.
When you are done, exit and delete the cluster.

```bash
pcluster delete-cluster --region us-east-2 --cluster-name test-cluster
```

Delete the parallel cluster stack:

```bash
aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation list-stacks \
   --stack-status-filter "CREATE_COMPLETE" \
   --query "StackSummaries[].StackName" | \
   grep -e "parallelclusternetworking-" 
```

And then find the parallel cluster one and delete it.

```bash
aws --region us-east-1 cloudformation delete-stack \
   --stack-name parallelclusternetworking-pub-20240121053431
```

And don't forget to delete the VPC manually in the interface!
